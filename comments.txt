technically I just did cross-correlation instead of convolution, but the result is the same when opposite directions are put in the same bin, and it's slightly less work.
If I constructed flipped versions of the sobel filters, then it'd be actual convolution, but again, which direction you define as positive x/positive y is arbitrary, so...
(I zero-padded the input image to calculate the gradients, though I noticed in the solution another option would have been to simply ignore out-of-bounds indeces)

I noticed I had to do atan2(x/y) rather than atan2(y/x) to get the output image to look right. Makes sense, as this way the lines are tangent rather than perpendicular
